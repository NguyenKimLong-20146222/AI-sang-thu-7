1. There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
- Artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science. An intelligence created by humans with the goal of helping computers to automate intelligent behaviors like humans.
- In the era of flourishing industry 4.0, "Artificial Intelligence" is a factor that cannot be ignored. Today, artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence) technology is considered as one of the leading important technologies, helping people to solve many problems in life. This field is attracting great attention globally thanks to innovations with so modern and outstanding features.

2. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?
- AI - Artificial Intelligence is considered as human intelligence that is simulated and used by machines.
-  Meanwhile, Machine Learning is a method to conquer AI, making it possible for machines to simulate that intelligence.
- Finally, Deep Learning is a technique to realize Machine Learning
* The differences between the three terms:
- AI:
+ AI is the simulation of human intellectual processes by machines, especially computer systems.
+ AI makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks.
+ AI is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that act and react like humans.
+ Specific applications of AI include natural language processing, speech and vision recognition, system management, and more.
- Machine Learning:
+ A subfield of AI that uses algorithms that allow computers to learn from data to perform tasks instead of being explicitly programmed.
+ It has the ability to self-learn based on input without having to be specifically programmed.
- Deep Learning:
+ As a method of Machine learning
+ Allows us to train an AI that can predict outputs based on a set of inputs.
+ Help the computer solve a series of complex problems that cannot be solved.
+ It is like a “neural network” that can process data similar to what a human brain can do in that the machine trains itself.
+ Requires a lot of input and computing power.

3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
    Artificial Intelligence Applications: Social Media
- Ever since social media has become our identity, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data through chats, tweets, posts and so on. And wherever there is an abundance of data, AI and Machine Learning are always present.
- In social media platforms like Facebook, AI is used for face verification wherein machine learning and deep learning concepts are used to detect facial features and tag your friends. Deep Learning is used to extract every minute detail from an image by using a bunch of deep neural networks. On the other hand, Machine learning algorithms are used to design your feed based on your interests.
-  Another such example is Twitter’s AI, which is being used to identify hate speech and terroristic language in tweets. It makes use of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural language processing to filter out offensive content. The company discovered and banned 300,000 terrorist-linked accounts, 95% of which were found by non-human, artificially intelligent machines.
- These are just a few examples of how AI works behind the scenes to power features of the world's most popular social networks. And, across all social media platforms and each social media post, an AI algorithm or machine learning system is regulating how the content you create and the ads you buy are placed in front of users-often in ways that aren't entirely transparent to marketers. This is all to say that AI is a fundamental part of how today's social networks function. But, AI often operates behind the scenes of popular platforms, and entirely at the discretion of the company that owns the platform. However, that doesn't mean marketers can't leverage AI for their social media strategy. In fact, there are many commercially available artificial intelligence social media monitoring and marketing tools across a number of use cases.

4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules
 - The Ascend 910 is a new AI processor that belongs to Ascend-Max chipsets. After a year of ongoing development, test results now show that the Ascend 910 processor delivers on its performance goals with much lower power consumption than originally planned. For half-precision floating point (FP16) operations, Ascend 910 delivers 256 TeraFLOPS. For integer precision calculations (INT8), it delivers 512 TeraOPS. Despite its unrivaled performance. Ascend 910's max power consumption is only 310W, much lower than its planned specs (350W).
* Four modules:
- Module 1 – Preparatory Sessions – Python & Linux: Session object allows one to persist certain parameters across requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance and will use urllib3’s connection pooling. So, if several requests are being made to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase. A session object all the methods as of requests.
- Module 2 – Machine Learning & Prediction Algorithms: Machine learning is used to build models that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Among the many sub-domains of machine learning, the one that usually gets the most attention is known as supervised learning. It is most accessible and provides a great introduction to the wider world of machine learning. 'Supervised' refers to the fact that each sample within the data being used to build the system contains an associated label. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the value of the label when presented with new data. Participants will also learn how to choose an appropriate model and about the general trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability.
- Module 3 – Data Analysis with MS Excel: Excel is very widely used for the analysis and communication of data. This module introduces students to many of the key features of the Excel spreadsheet environment, with a focus on using it to solve real-world problems using numerical techniques. Much of the module will be “hands on” in the computer laboratories, with a series of worksheets, assignments and problems to solve.
- Module 4 – Natural Language Processing and its Applications: The aim of the module is to equip students with a fundamental understanding of automated methods for processing linguistic data in textual form (natural language processing) from different sources (newswire, web, social media, academic publications) and associated challenges. The module will also provide students with the skills to analyze textual data and familiarize them with state of the art tools and applications.

5. Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.
- Currently, the use of Chatbots, such as Google's voice assistants, Alexa, Siri or Alisa, simplifies some work processes as well as allows connection to smart devices for remote control. Touch is becoming very popular. As you can see, Chatbots are not new but their capabilities are definitely expanding and AI is making them more human every year. According to Gartner, by 2022, AI will manage 70% of all consumer communications. But it doesn't just stop at customer service support, but Chatbot will also be connected to other electronic payment systems and payment gateways by 2022.
- Not only that, AI-driven Chatbots help automate administrative tasks. In healthcare, for example, they will help ease manual workload, help organize appointments, send reminders related to taking medications, and provide patients with answers to questions. question. In other areas, Chatbots are introduced to deliver specified messages, improve customer interaction and support, and provide users with personalized offers.
- Recently, OpenAI (American company specializing in AI technology research and implementation) has released GPT-3, the largest and most advanced language model ever created. This model includes 175 billion variables and data points for language processing, and they can generate 4.7 billion words on average per day. Not stopping there, OpenAI is known to be working on a GPT-4 sequel that will be even more powerful and estimates that it could be many times more powerful than GPT-3 and predicts this will be It's a huge step forward to being able to create AI-generated conversations that are indistinguishable from a human conversation.
